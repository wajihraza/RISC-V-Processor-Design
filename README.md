# RISC-V Processor Design and it's FPGA Implementation

This repo is an implementation of RISC-V Processor design in Verilog. This project was done in a Microprocessor System's course, to gain more understanding of architecture implementation and the use of Instruction Set Architecture (ISA). 

The code can be synthesised on an FPGA to observe results.
